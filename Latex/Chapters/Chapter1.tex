In this Chapter I am going to describe about Birkhoff polytope $B_n$ which is sometimes considered to be one of the most important polytopes in many sphere. Before that I will define some basic types.
\section{Hypermatrix}

A generalisation of matrix to an $n_1 \times n_1 \times ...$ array of numbers.

Example: 3-dimensional hypermatrix(cube). It is a $2 \times 2 \times 2$ matrix over $\mathbb{R}$.


\section{What is Polytopes}

In elementary geometry, a polytope is a geometric object with flat sides, and may exist in any general number of dimensions n as an n-dimensional polytope or n-polytope. For example a two-dimensional polygon is a 2-polytope and a three-dimensional polyhedron is a 3-polytope

Mathematically, A polytope $P\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is the convex hull $P=conv(v_1,...,v_k)$ of a finite set of points $v_1,...,v_k \in \mathbb{R}^d$ . Dually any polytope can be written as the bounded intersection of a finite number of affine half-spaces in the form $P = \{ x\mid Ax \leq b \}$

\subsection{Elements of polytope}
A proper face of $F$ of a polytope $P$ is the intersection of $P$ with and affine hyperplane $H$ such that $P$ is completely contained in one of the closed half spaces defined by $H$. The empty set and the polytope P a face of $P$. Any face $F$ is itself  polytope. The dimension of a polytope $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is the dimension of the minimum affine space containin it. It is full dimensional if its dimension is d.

0-dimensional faces of $P$ are called $vertices$, 1-dimensional faces are edges. Proper faces of maximal dimensional are called facets. $P$ is the convex hull of its vertices, and the vertices of any face are subset of the vertices of $P$. Thus, a polytope has only a finite number of faces. Let $f_i$ be the number of $i$-dimensional faces of $P,0 \leq i \leq dim P-1$. The $f$-vector of a d-dimensional polytope P is the non-negative integral vector $f(P) = (f_0,...,f_(d-1)$.

The face lettice or combinatorial type $\mathcal{L}(P)$ of a polytope P is the partially ordered set of all faces of P (including the empty face and P itself). This defines Eulerian lattice. Figure shows 2.1 this lattice.
\begin{figure}\centering\includegraphics{Figures/Eulerian.png}\decoRule\caption[]{A triangle and its face lattice.}\label{Eulerian}\end{figure}

It contains all combinatorial information of the polytope. Two polytopes P,$P'$ are combinatorially isomorphic or have the same combinatorial type if their face lattices are isomorphic as posets.

An r-dimensional simplex (or r-simplex) is the convex hull of r+1 affinely independent points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. A polytope is called simplicial if all facets are simplices. It is simple if the dual is simplicial. Equally, a d-dimensilanl polytope P is simple if each vertex is incident to precisely d edges. The d-dimensional 0/1-cube $C^d$ is the convexhull of all d-dimensinal 0/1-vectors. This is a simple d-polytope with $2^d$ vertices and 2d facets. More generally we denote by a d-cube any d-dimensional polytope that is combinatorially isomorphic to the 0/1-cube (it need not be full dimensional).

\subsection{Properties of Polytope}
Let $P_1 \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_1}$ and $P_2 \subset \mathbb{R}^{d_2}$ be two (geometrically realized) polytopes with vertex sets $V(P_1)=\{ v_1,...,v_k$ and $V(P_2)=\{ w_1,...,w_l \}$. With $0^{(d)}$ we denote he d-dimensional zero vector.

The (geometric) product of $P_1$ and $P_2$ is the polytope

\begin{equation}P_1 \times P_2 = conv( (v_i,w_i)\in \mathbb{R}^{d_1+d_2}\mid 1\leq i \leq k, i \leq j \leq l)\label{eqn:Einstein}\end{equation}

This is the same as the set of all points $(v,w)$ for $v \in P_1$ and $w \in P_2$. The (geometric) join of $P_1$ and $P_2$ is the polytope

\begin{equation}P_1 \star P_2 := conv(P_1 \times \{ 0^{d_2} \} \times \{ 0 \} \cup \{ 0^{d_1} \} \times P_2 \times \{ 1 \} ) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d_1+d_2+1}\label{eqn:Einstein}\end{equation}

More generally we say that a polytope P is a product or join of two polytopes $P_1$ and $P_2$, if P is combinatorially isomorphic to the geometric prouct or geometric join of some realisations of the face lattices $P_1$, or $P_2$.

If $F$ is face of a polytope  $P = \{ x \mid Ax \leq b \} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$  and $ \langle c,x \rangle \leq d $ a linear funtional defining F, then the $wedge wedge_F(P)$ of P over F is defined to be the polytope.
 
\begin{equation}wedge_F(P) = \{ (x,x_0) \in \mathbb{R}^{d+1} \mid Ax\leq b, 0\leq x_0 \leq d- \langle c,x \rangle\}\label{eqn:Einstein}\end{equation}

Again, we say more generally that P is wedge of a polytope  Q over some face F of Q if P is combinatorially equivalently to $wedge_F(Q)$

\section{What is Birkhoff Polytope}

Birkhoff polytope $B_n$ is sometimes considered to be one of the most important polytopes in many sphere. Birkhoff polytope is also called assignment polytope, the polytope of doubly stochastic matrices, or the perfect matching polytope of complete bipartite graph $K_(n,n)$ ,transportation polytope. It surprisingly appears in various branches of mathematics from geometry to enumerative combinatorics to optimisation theory to Statistics.

The Birkhoff polytope $B_n$ is the convex hull of all $(n\times n)$ permutation metrices, i.e.matrices which consists precisely one 1 in every row and column, and zeros at all places. Equivalently, $B_n$ is the set of all non-negative $(n \times n)$-metrices, whose rows and columns all sum to 1, or the perfect matching polytope of the complete bipartite graph $K_(n,n)$. The Birkhoff polytope $B_n$ has dimension $(n-1)^2$ with $n!$ vertices and $n_2$ facets. The Birkhoff-von Neumann Theoram illustrated, $B_n$ can be understood as the intersection of the positive orthant with a family of of hyperplanes.

Birkhoff polytopes are widely studied as a class of polytopes in the area of optimisation, statistics, enumerative combinatorics or representation theory. Despite, Combinatorial and Geometrical structure of Birkhoff polytope and its algorithmic treatment are still open to disover.

 Let $S_n$ be the group of permutations on $n$ elements. To any element $\sigma \in S_n$ we can associate a 0/1-matrix $M( \sigma ) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ that has a 1 at position (i,j) if and only if $\sigma(i)=j$. The n-th Birkhoff polytope is:
\begin{equation}\mathbb{B} = conv(M( \sigma ) \mid \sigma \in S_n ) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}\label{eqn:Einstein}\end{equation}	

The Birkhoff-von Neumann Theorem shows that $\mathbb{B}_n$ can equally be characterized as the set of all non-negative $(n \times n)$ -matrices whose rows and columns all sum to 1. Equivalently, the facets of $\mathbb{B}_n$ are precisely defined by the inequalities $x_{ij} \geq 0 for 1 \leq i, j \leq n$. It has dimension $(n-1)^2$ with $n^2$ facets and $n!$ vertices.
