	Abstract = {The Birkhoff polytope B(n) is the convex hull of all (n x n) permutation matrices, i.e., matrices where precisely one entry in each row and column is one, and zeros at all other places. This is a widely studied polytope with various applications throughout mathematics. In this paper we study combinatorial types L of faces of a Birkhoff polytope. The Birkhoff dimension bd(L) of L is the smallest n such that B(n) has a face with combinatorial type L. 
	By a result of Billera and Sarangarajan, a combinatorial type L of a d-dimensional face appears in some B(k) for k less or equal to 2d, so bd(L) is at most d. We will characterize those types whose Birkhoff dimension is at least 2d-3, and we prove that any type whose Birkhoff dimension is at least d is either a product or a wedge over some lower dimensional face. Further, we computationally classify all d-dimensional combinatorial types for d between 2 and 8..},

	Abstract = {We present a multivariate generating function for all n x n nonnegative integral matrices with all row and column sums equal to a positive integer t, the so called semi-magic squares. As a consequence we obtain formulas for all coefficients of the Ehrhart polynomial of the polytope B_n of n x n doubly-stochastic matrices, also known as the Birkhoff polytope. In particular we derive formulas for the volumes of B_n and any of its faces..},

	Abstract = {We consider solving degenerate quadratic programs (QPs) by means of degeneracy-benefiting techniques designed for linear programs (LPs). Specifically, we use a Simplex pivot method, called positive edge, that is able to take advantage of degeneracy in LPs. First, we improve the efficiency of the positive edge method by providing an internal implementation of it using CLP—an open-source LP solver. In the next stage, we develop a software, called CyLP, which allows easy definition of, and experimentation with, Simplex pivot rules. In addition, CyLP has a powerful modeling facility that reduces the effort of modeling LPs, mixed-integer pro- grams (MIPs), and QPs. Using CyLP, we apply the positive edge rule to Wolfe’s method—a Simplex-like method for QPs. We also incorporate positive edge into a reduced-gradient me- thod. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of positive edge on QPs with relatively large linear terms. Each method is able to yield substantial improvements on a subset of test problems. We provide research leads to devise novel methods that incorporate the positive edge rule and are more generally applicable..},
